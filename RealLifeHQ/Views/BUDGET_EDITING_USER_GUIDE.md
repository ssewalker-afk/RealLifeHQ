## What You Can Edit

### 1. Monthly Income

**To change it:**
- Tap the income field

### 2. Budget Percentages (50/30/20 Rule)
Adjust how you split your money between Needs, Wants, and Savings.

**Default split:**

- 30% Wants (entertainment, dining out)
- 20% Savings (emergency fund, investments)

**To adjust:**
- Use the sliders to change percentages
- Watch the dollar amounts update in real-time
- Make sure the total equals 100% (Save button will be disabled if not)

**💡 Tip:** If your percentages don't add up to 100%, you'll see a red warning and can't save.

### 3. Category Names
Personalize category names to match your lifestyle.

**To rename a category:**
- Find the category in its section (Needs, Wants, or Savings)
- Tap the name field
- Type the new name
- The name saves when you tap "Save" at the top

**Examples:**
- Change "Housing" to "Rent" or "Mortgage"
- Change "Food" to "Groceries" or "Food & Dining"
- Change "Entertainment" to "Fun Money" or "Hobbies"

### 4. Category Budget Limits
Set exactly how much you want to spend in each category per month.

**To adjust a limit:**
- Find the "Budget Limit" field under the category name
- Tap it and enter the new amount
- Watch the section total update

**Smart Tracking:**
- Each section shows "Allocated" vs "Available" amounts
- Green means you're within budget
- Red means you've allocated more than your percentage allows
- Blue info text shows unallocated funds

**Example:**
```
Needs Categories
$2,400 of $2,500

💡 $100 unallocated
```

## Adding New Categories

Each section (Needs, Wants, Savings) can have multiple categories.

**To add a category:**
1. Scroll to the section where you want to add it
2. Tap **"Add Category"** at the bottom of that section
3. Fill in:
   - Category name
   - Budget limit
   - Icon (tap "Change" to pick one)
4. Tap **"Add"**

The new category appears immediately in the list.

## Deleting Categories

**To remove a category:**
1. Find the category you want to delete
2. Tap the **trash icon** on the right
3. Confirm deletion in the alert

**⚠️ Important:** 
- Deleting a category doesn't delete past expenses in that category
- Those expenses will still show in your history
- You just won't be able to add new expenses to this category

## Understanding Budget Allocation

Each section shows helpful information:

### Section Headers
```
Needs Categories
$2,500 of $2,500
```
- Left number: Total you've allocated across all Needs categories
- Right number: Total available for Needs based on your percentage

### Section Footers
- **💡 $100 unallocated:** You have money in this category type that isn't assigned to a specific category
- **⚠️ Over budget by $150:** You've allocated more than your percentage allows

### Why this matters:
If you allocate more than available, you're going over budget. Adjust category limits or change your percentage split to fix this.

## Resetting to Defaults

Need to start fresh?

**To reset percentages:**
1. Scroll to the bottom
2. Tap **"Reset to 50/30/20 Rule"**
3. Your percentages return to:
   - 50% Needs
   - 30% Wants  
   - 20% Savings

**Note:** This only resets percentages, not your:
- Income amount
- Category names
- Category limits
- Icons or colors

## Saving Your Changes

**The Save button is at the top right:**
- **Enabled (blue):** Your budget is valid and ready to save
- **Disabled (gray):** Something needs fixing (usually percentages ≠ 100%)

**When you tap Save:**
- All changes are saved immediately
- The budget screen updates to reflect your changes
- Your spending tracking uses the new categories and limits

**To cancel without saving:**
- Tap "Cancel" in the top left
- All changes are discarded
- Your budget remains unchanged

## Pro Tips

### 1. Balance Your Categories
Watch the allocated vs available amounts in each section. Try to use all your available budget—leaving money unallocated means you're not planning how to use it.

### 2. Be Realistic
Set category limits based on your actual spending, not wishful thinking. Check your past expenses to see what you really spend.

### 3. Start Simple
Begin with fewer categories and add more as needed. Too many categories can be overwhelming.

**Good starting point:**
- **Needs:** Housing, Groceries, Transportation
- **Wants:** Entertainment, Dining Out
- **Savings:** Emergency Fund

### 4. Review Regularly
Life changes! Review your budget monthly and adjust as needed. Major life events (new job, moving, having kids) should trigger a budget review.

### 5. Use Descriptive Names
Make category names clear and specific to you:
- Instead of "Bills" → use "Utilities" or "Phone & Internet"
- Instead of "Fun" → use "Movies & Entertainment"
- Instead of "Food" → split into "Groceries" and "Restaurants"

### 6. Color Code Smartly
Use colors that make sense to you:
- Red for important fixed expenses
- Green for savings goals
- Blue for flexible spending
- Your choice—make it intuitive!

### 7. Plan for the Irregular
Create categories for expenses that don't happen every month:
- "Annual Subscriptions" (divide yearly cost by 12)
- "Car Maintenance" (save monthly for repairs)
- "Gifts" (birthdays, holidays)

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I have more than one savings category?**
A: Yes! Create multiple savings categories for different goals (Emergency Fund, Vacation, New Car, etc.)

**Q: What happens to my expenses when I change a category?**
A: Past expenses keep their original category name and amount. Only future expenses use the updated category.

**Q: Can I change the percentage split to something other than 50/30/20?**
A: Absolutely! The 50/30/20 rule is just a guideline. Adjust the sliders to match your needs. Some people do 60/20/20 or 40/30/30.

**Q: Why can't I save my budget?**
A: The most common reason is percentages don't add up to 100%. Check the total at the bottom of the Budget Distribution section.

**Q: Can I add more than 6 categories?**
A: Yes! There's no limit. Add as many as you need to track your spending effectively.

**Q: I'm over budget in one section. What should I do?**
A: You have three options:
1. Reduce individual category limits until you're within budget
2. Increase the percentage for that section (and decrease others)
3. Increase your income amount if it was entered incorrectly
